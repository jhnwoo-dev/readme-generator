# readme-generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a program that would streamline the writing process for a README. I built this project to produce a README that would be created simply through user inputs. This solves the user's hassle of having to find a template and delete and replace information to create a professional README file. Throughout this project I learned how to prompt a user with questions and use the collected data to create a simple formatted document of my choice.

## Installation

You will follow the normal git cloning procedures and clone into the directory of your choice. Once you have cloned the repo, you will create your package.json file if you do not already have one, and will proceed to install the inquirer version 8.2.4 - after that, you will run the node index.js command in the terminal and input info as you are prompted.
